# cmo_digits

Handwritten Digit recogniser done as part of the Computational Methods and Optimisation Course at Plaksha

## Training

You can import the `Network` class and train it with different hyperparameters and training data or
you can use `train.py`.

Check the usage of `train.py`:

- `python3 train.py --help`

## Results
